I have a Next.js app with two key folders:

/widget: this contains the embeddable script customers place on their site (like Userflow does).

/extension: this is our Chrome extension, which I want to remove.

Instead of the extension, I want to move all inspector/selector-picking functionality into the app + widget flow.

What I want

A new page in the Next.js app:

Accessible only to logged-in users (e.g., /inspector).

When opened, it loads an iframe that points to the customer’s site (they’ll enter the URL).

This iframe should load with our /widget script automatically injected.

Selector Inspector Experience (inside iframe):

Users can toggle “Inspect Mode” from the app UI.

In Inspect Mode, hovering highlights DOM elements with a visible border (like Chrome DevTools inspector).

Clicking an element captures its CSS selector or a stable unique path.

That data is passed back to the parent Next.js app (via postMessage or a bridge).

User Experience Requirements:

Smooth toggle between “Inspect Mode” and normal browsing.

A clear highlight overlay (e.g., blue outline + tooltip with tag name).

On click, show a small popup (inside the iframe) that says “Element captured ✅”.

In the parent app (outside the iframe), maintain a sidebar or panel where all captured selectors are listed in order.

Technical Implementation Notes:

The iframe injection should use our existing /widget script.

Use postMessage to send element data (selector, innerText, attributes) to the Next.js parent app.

Use React state in the Next.js app to store and display captured selectors.

Consider a helper like css-selector-generator
 for reliable selectors.

Ensure no extension is needed — the iframe + widget handle everything.

End Goal:

This fully replaces the need for a browser extension.

Customers log into our Next.js app → go to /inspector → open their site in an iframe → click through their own site → we store selectors for later use in onboarding flows.


What we need:

In-app inspector workflow

A dedicated page inside our Next.js app: /inspector

This page contains an iframe where the user loads their own site (we’ll ask them to input their site URL).

Once loaded, the user can interactively select elements on their site inside the iframe.

On hover → highlight the element (blue outline).

On click → lock selection, show a small tooltip with the CSS selector + actions.

Selector storage

After selecting, we need a panel (sidebar inside /inspector) where all chosen selectors are listed.

Each entry shows:

A friendly label input (user can rename)

The CSS selector string

A "delete" button to remove

All stored selectors should sync with our backend (simple POST/PUT endpoint) so the main app can reuse them.

UX details

The iframe should feel “live” — users should be able to click around naturally.

When they hover an element, show a thin overlay with label “Click to select”.

After clicking, freeze hover mode and display a small floating tooltip above the element with:

✅ Confirm button (adds to sidebar)

❌ Cancel button (exit without saving)

Sidebar should always be visible on the right, with smooth animations when adding/removing selectors.

Implementation hints

Use postMessage for iframe ↔ parent app communication.

Example: when the user selects an element inside the iframe, send { type: 'ELEMENT_SELECTED', selector: '...' } to the parent.

Parent receives and updates the sidebar list.

For highlighting inside the iframe: inject a small helper script that attaches mouseover, mouseout, and click listeners.

Consider using a lightweight library like CSSSelectorGenerator (https://github.com/fczbkk/css-selector-generator
) for accurate selectors.

UI in Next.js can be built with Tailwind + shadcn/ui for sidebar + panels.

File organization

pages/inspector.tsx → main page with iframe + sidebar

lib/iframe-injector.ts → script we inject into iframe for element selection/highlighting

components/InspectorSidebar.tsx → list of selectors with edit/delete

api/selectors → endpoint to save selectors

Final goal (UX summary)

The customer logs into our app → goes to /inspector

Enters their site URL → site loads in iframe

They hover → elements highlight

They click → tooltip appears → confirm adds selector to sidebar

Sidebar keeps track of all selectors (editable, removable)

Saved selectors sync to backend for later use in workflows
