This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# 📢 Notifications.fyi

## Overview
Notifications.fyi is a lightweight, privacy-first notification service designed for SaaS companies, indie hackers, and product teams who want to keep users informed without overpaying for bloated notification infrastructure.

Our key differentiator: **pricing that doesn’t punish you for growing MAUs**. Most competitors scale costs with users, but our approach keeps operational costs flat while giving you the flexibility to add notifications where they matter.

---

## 🎯 Target Personas

- **Indie Hackers / Solo Founders**  
  Want to ship quickly without worrying about setting up complex notification systems. They need something that “just works” and doesn’t cost a fortune.

- **Small SaaS Teams**  
  Value simplicity and predictable pricing. Notifications should enhance their product, not add another heavy operational cost.

- **Growing Startups**  
  Care about scalability and flexibility, but don’t want to be locked into per-MAU pricing traps as they grow.

- **Enterprise Teams**  
  Need advanced features like compliance, delivery guarantees, analytics, and integration into existing workflows.

---

## 💡 Our Vision

We believe notifications should be:
- **Predictable in cost** → No hidden surprises when your product scales.  
- **Simple to implement** → Drop-in integrations, clear APIs, and minimal setup.  
- **Flexible** → Works across in-app, email, and push channels without over-engineering.  
- **Respectful of users** → Notifications that add value, not noise.

Our ultimate goal is to make notifications a **first-class experience** for both developers and end-users.
